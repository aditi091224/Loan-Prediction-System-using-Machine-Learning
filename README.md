## Overview
The Loan Prediction Management System is designed to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process by leveraging machine learning techniques. The repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation necessary to understand, implement, and experiment with different loan prediction models.

## Features
Preprocessing tools to clean and prepare raw data for training.
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for loan prediction.
Model evaluation scripts to measure prediction performance.
Jupyter notebooks illustrating data analysis and model development.
User-friendly command-line interface for model deployment and prediction.
## Installation
- **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/aditi091224/Loan-Prediction-Management-System.git
cd Loan-Prediction-Management-System

- **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
- **Install required dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory for data analysis and model development.

- Use the provided dataset in the data directory or replace it with your own data.

- Train and evaluate different machine learning models using the scripts in the src directory.

- Deploy a trained model using the command-line interface:

  python src/predict.py
## Dataset
- The project uses a dataset containing historical loan application information. The dataset is available in the data directory and is used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

- Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning algorithms are implemented for loan prediction, including:

-- Logistic Regression                         -- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-- Gradient Boosting                           -- Random Forest
